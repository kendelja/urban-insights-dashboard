# NOTE: V1: 
#           - Gathered Data
#           - Cleaned Data CSV
#           - Ability to access specific data points
#           - Calculated a rough crime rate value per neighbourhood and stored it respectively in a dictionary
#
# NOTE: V2:
#           - Imported crime dictionary into main.py
#           - Starting GUI with Tkinter built
#           - Menu selection screen involving city selection (Toronto only for now)
#
# NOTE: V3: 
#           - Merged CrimeValue with geojson data for Toronto neighbourhoods
#           - Switched to fastapi and react instead of folium and tkinter
#           - Created basic fastapi backend to serve neighbourhood data (/neighbourhoods endpoint)
#
# NOTE: V4:
#           - Created basic react frontend to display map with neighbourhood polygons
#           - Integrated Leaflet map into react frontend
#           - Fetched neighbourhood data from fastapi backend and displayed polygons on map
#
# NOTE: V5:
#           - Added color coding to neighbourhood polygons based on crime score
#           - Implemented hover effect to highlight neighbourhood polygons (Not working perfectly yet)
# NOTE: V6:
#           - Improved color gradient for crime scores
#           - Added tooltips to display neighbourhood names and crime scores on hover
#           - Fixed hover effect to ensure only one polygon is highlighted at a time
#           - Need to fix when zoomed - tooltip displays all neighbourhood names without hover
#           - Need to add more stats (Rating top worst/best neighbourhoods, population, what years data is from, etc.)

# NOTE: V1: 
#           - Gathered Data
#           - Cleaned Data CSV
#           - Ability to access specific data points
#           - Calculated a rough crime rate value per neighbourhood and stored it respectively in a dictionary
#
# NOTE: V2:
#           - Imported crime dictionary into main.py
#           - Starting GUI with Tkinter built
#           - Menu selection screen involving city selection (Toronto only for now)
#
# NOTE: V3: 
#           - Merged CrimeValue with geojson data for Toronto neighbourhoods
#           - Switched to fastapi and react instead of folium and tkinter
#           - Created basic fastapi backend to serve neighbourhood data (/neighbourhoods endpoint)
#
# NOTE: V4: Steps
#           - NOTE: Setup leaflet but its erroring - may need earlier react version? Do i need two nodemodules?
#           - Install Leaflet, Build React/Leaflet frontend to visualize neighbourhood data
#           - Create basemap with Leaflet
#           - Connect frontend to backend to fetch neighbourhood data and display on map
#           - Pass data to leaflet - display polygons with colour coding based on crime rate
#           - Add interactivity (tooltips/popups) to show detailed neighbourhood info on click/hover
#           - Test end-to-end functionality and fix bugs
